# dwm
This is my minimal daily driver build of dwm. I have added some extra futures such as full screen mode and Gaps. 

## Key bindings
This can be found in the config.h file.

## Installation
Same as DWM, simply clone this repo cd in the directory and build it with `sudo make clean install`.

## Dependences/Default apps

### There are quite a few dependences in my build of dwm, I can't list them all but here are a few:

* My [slstatus build](https://github.com/JaceReid/slstatus) build
* Ranger
* Kitty
* A Nerd font
